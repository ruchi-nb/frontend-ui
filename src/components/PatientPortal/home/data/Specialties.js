  Cardiology: {
    description: "Heart and cardiovascular health",
    longDescription: "Cardiology is the branch of medicine that deals with the heart and blood vessels (the cardiovascular system). It focuses on the structure, function, and diseases of the heart—as well as the network of arteries, veins, and capillaries that carry blood throughout the body.At its core, cardiology is about understanding how the heart works as a muscular pump. This pump keeps blood circulating, supplying oxygen and nutrients to tissues and organs while removing waste products. Any disruption in this system—whether from blocked arteries, weakened heart muscle, abnormal rhythms, or valve problems—can lead to cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death worldwide.",

  Dermatology: {
    description: "Skin, hair, and nail care",
    longDescription: "Dermatology is the branch of medicine that focuses on the study, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of conditions related to the skin, hair, nails, and mucous membranes. Because the skin is the body’s largest organ and serves as the first line of defense against infections, injuries, and environmental factors, dermatology plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health as well as appearance. A dermatologist is a medical doctor trained to identify and manage a wide range of issues, from common concerns such as acne, eczema, and psoriasis to more complex diseases like autoimmune skin disorders, rare genetic conditions, and skin cancers such as melanoma. Dermatology also covers conditions that affect the scalp and hair (like alopecia), and nails (such as fungal infections or nail disorders), making it broader than many people realize.",

  "General Medicine": {
    description: "Primary healthcare and wellness",
    longDescription: "General medicine—also known as internal medicine in many regions—is one of the broadest and most foundational fields of medicine. It is focused on the comprehensive care of adult patients, addressing everything from routine health maintenance to the management of complex, chronic, or undiagnosed conditions. Unlike specialties that concentrate on a particular organ system (such as cardiology or neurology), general medicine takes a whole-body, whole-person approach to health care.",

  Pediatrics: {
    description: "Healthcare for children and adolescents",
    longDescription: "Pediatrics is the branch of medicine that focuses on the health and medical care of infants, children, and adolescents, typically from birth up to 18 years of age (sometimes extending into the early 20s depending on the healthcare system). It is a specialty that not only deals with diagnosing and treating illnesses in young patients, but also emphasizes preventive health, growth and development monitoring, and guidance for parents and families.Unlike adult medicine, pediatrics requires a unique approach because children are not just “small adults.” Their bodies are developing, their immune systems are still maturing, and their physical, emotional, and cognitive needs differ significantly from those of adults.",
